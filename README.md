ðŸŽ® **D2S**
My non-commercial fandom-of-sorts for Destiny 2. The plan has changed significantly since I attempted this a year ago so here it is:

D2S is a website that will hold basic information regardly weekly acitivites in the game and use the Destiny 2 API to list and update the appropriate material whilst displaying my articles on the best strategies for those activities.

This project is meant for my friends however a website is a good challenge to spice things up.

The following information will change as time goes on, as I would greatly appreciate feedback on my projects to help further understand coding/programming.
Thank you.
