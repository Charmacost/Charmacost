Hello and welcome to my GitHub page!
------------------------------------
My name is Michael and I am currently a college student studying computer science (FY).

Most reposities made here either **assignments** or **personal projects**, which I'll make clear.

I currently am working with **C++** and **HTML/CSS**, so here is the rundown:


 Personal Projects
-------------------

ðŸŽ® d2trategies --> My non-commercial fandom-of-sorts for Destiny 2. Holds images and links for many of the documents I have written about the game.

                   			This is purely just porting code over from a different hosting site, in which this will become a GitHub Page.
                      
                   				**Notes - Uses HTML & CSS ONLY; NO JAVASCRIPT**
_Link - https://github.com/d2strategies/d2strategies.github.io_


   Assignments
------------------

None Currently :) 

_(Will add some older C++ assignments at some point)_


   Conclusion
-----------------

The following information will change as time goes on, as I would greatly appreciate feedback on my projects to help further understand coding/programming.
Thank you.
